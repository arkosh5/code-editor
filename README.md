# Code Editor App
This is a simple web application that allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a browser-based text editor and preview the result in an iframe below. You can select from four different code editor themes, save your code, load saved code, and clear the editor. The application also includes linting for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

# Getting started
